# RllTrails
A mobile-friendly shiny app to visualize custom AllTrails Lists.

The map UI on the Android version of AllTrails sucks (at least on my phone) and the app doesn't allow you to visualize a user-created list of trails on a map.
This app uses `shiny` and `shinyMobile` to create a mobile-friendly map of a custom AllTrails list using `leaflet`.

The app is available here: [https://jzemmels.shinyapps.io/RllTrails/](https://jzemmels.shinyapps.io/RllTrails/)
